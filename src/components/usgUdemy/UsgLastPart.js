                everyone. In 2020, we launched the Udemy Free Resource Center —
                a curated collection of almost 600 free courses to help people
                everywhere navigate new challenges and pursue new opportunities.
                Since then, over one million people have enrolled in Udemy Free
                Resource Center courses.

              At Udemy, we’re humbled by the opportunity to open access to
              education — especially for those whose opportunities have
              historically been limited. To do this, we’ve partnered with a
              number of organizations.
